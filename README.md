# SwiftGate
SwiftGate is a bridging protocol that allows users to bridge their assets between different chains with minimal costs. 

This is possible since SwiftGate uses a network of 13 governors that individually sign and verify each message - in exchange, the governors are paid with AAVE yield generated by the interactions of this protocol.

SwiftGate allows for instant verification and instant trustless bridging - this is possible because messages from different users are verified in batches, which provides a cheap and fast solution.

Currently, SwiftGate is ERC-20 compatible, with contracts that interact with each token being deployed by a TokenFactory contract that uses OpenZeppelin's ERC1167 implementation to inexpensive clone the contracts needed to interact with a given token.
